  <p>Welcome to the AFL, the Armchair Football League. This is a 10‐team league that was formed in 2021 by a group of owners who all love fantasy football and wanted more than the average league. This league is considered a money league, and all owners are expected to pay their league fee before the draft begins. This league is designed to be a competition between owners, but it not a cut‐throat league where 
anything goes. The rules described below are designed to act as a guideline for overall league play, and any disputes will be handled by the executive committee of the league. Please remember that the overall goal of this league is to have fun and enjoy the game of fantasy football. If you have any question or concerns, please do not hesitate to ask.
